                <p>This section details the hardware setup utilized in our project. It covers the selected components, their specifications, interconnections, and the rationale behind each design choice to ensure optimal performance and compatibility.</p>
<p>Due to current German aviation regulations, our drone must not exceed a total weight of 250 grams. This threshold allows operation without formal registration or special permits, significantly simplifying compliance while still enabling a fully functional and capable system within strict weight constraints.</p>
<h1 id="hardware-components">Hardware Components</h1>
<ul>
<li>

<ul>
<li>The frame serves as the structural foundation of the drone, providing mounting points for all essential components such as motors, flight controller, battery, and sensors. It must be both lightweight and durable to meet the strict 250 g weight limit while ensuring mechanical stability during flight.</li>
<li>In our case, we use a 5-inch (5 Zoll) frame with a total weight of 177.4 g, which offers a good balance between size, stability, and compatibility with standard components. The frame costs around 77€, making it a solid mid-range option in terms of both performance and price.</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This results in a current total drone weight of approximately <code>608,9g</code>. The overall cost of the components is at around <code>431€</code>.</p>
<h1 id="drone-construction-overview">Drone Construction Overview</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Propeller Motors:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To connect the propeller motors to the flight controller, the propeller motors wires were soldered directly to the flight controller. The has specific solder pads for this purpose, making it easy to attach the motor wires directly to the board. The motor mapping - defining which motor corresponds to which output - an be configured either in Betaflight or conveniently through the SpeedyBee app on a smartphone. In addition to the motors, it was also necessary to solder a power cable and a capacitor to the flight controller. Both components share the same solder pads, so they had to be carefully connected to ensure proper power delivery.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><img src="/images/propellerMotorsSolderingPlan.jpg" alt="propeller motors soldering plan" /></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Video Transmitter:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To connect the video transmitter to the flight controller, four cables were used: black, red, white, and yellow.</p>
<ul>
<li>The black cable connects the GND pad on the video transmitter to a GND pad on the flight controller, ensuring a common ground.</li>
<li>The red cable supplies power by connecting the 5V output on the flight controller to the 5V input on the video transmitter. This means the flight controller also functions as a power supply for the VTX, eliminating the need for a separate power source.</li>
<li>The white cable connects the IRC pad (for control commands) on the video transmitter to the T3 pad on the flight controller. This allows the flight controller to send configuration commands to the VTX, such as changing channels or power levels.</li>
<li>The yellow cable connects the VTX pad on the flight controller to the video input pad on the video transmitter. This carries the video signal from the onboard camera, which is then transmitted to the FPV goggles.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><img src="/images/flightControllerVideoTransmitterSolderingPlan.jpg" alt="flight controller and video transmitter soldering plan" /></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Camera <code>Caddx Ratel PRO MN01 - 4000B</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To connect the camera to the flight controller, we used an extension board that simplifies and improves the soldering process. The 5V pad from the flight controller is connected to the V_IN pad on the extension board, while the GND pad on the flight controller is connected to the GND pad on the extension board. This setup ensures a reliable power and ground connection between the two components. Afterwards, the GND and power cable are connected to the corresponding pads on the extension board, while the remaining signal cables are soldered directly to the flight controller.</p>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>ELRS Receiver:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To connect the ELRS receiver to the flight controller, the following cable connections are required:</p>
<ul>
<li>The black cable is soldered to the GND pads on both the receiver and the flight controller to establish a common ground.</li>
<li>The red cable connects the VCC pad on the receiver to the 5V pad on the flight controller, supplying power to the receiver.</li>
<li>The white cable is soldered from the TX pad on the receiver to the R6 pad on the flight controller, allowing data transmission from the receiver to the controller.</li>
<li>The yellow cable connects the RX pad on the receiver to the T6 pad on the flight controller, enabling data transmission from the controller to the receiver.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><img src="/images/ELRSReceiverSolderingPlan.png" alt="ELRS receiver soldering plan" /></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>GPS Modul:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To connect the GPS module to the flight controller and ensure proper functionality, the following cable connections are required:</p>
<ul>
<li>The black cable is soldered to the GND pads on both the receiver and the flight controller to establish a common ground.</li>
<li>The red cable connects the VCC pad on the receiver to the 5V pad on the flight controller, supplying power to the receiver.</li>
<li>The yellow cable connects the TX pad on the GPS module to the R5 pad on the flight controller, allowing data to be sent from the GPS to the controller.</li>
<li>The white cable connects the RX pad on the GPS module to the T5 pad on the flight controller, enabling the controller to send data back to the GPS module.</li>
<li>The green cable connects the SCL pads on both devices, establishing the clock line for I2C communication.</li>
<li>The blue cable connects the SDA pads on both devices, providing the data line for I2C communication.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><img src="/images/GPSModulSolderingPlan.jpg" alt="GPS modul soldering plan" /></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Connection for the Raspberry Pi:</p>
<ul>
<li>To ensure proper power supply to the Raspberry Pi, two cables—one for ground (GND) and one for power—must be soldered to the flight controller. These connections can optionally be made using the extension board to simplify the soldering process.
Additionally, it is possible to solder extra cables to enable GPIO communication between the Raspberry Pi and the flight controller. This GPIO traffic can include various types of data, such as telemetry, control signals, or sensor input. If soldering is not feasible—for example, due to space constraints or hardware limitations—Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) or a direct USB connection can serve as alternative communication methods.</li>
<li>On the Raspberry Pi side, the following GPIO pins are used:
<ul>
<li>Pin 4 provides the power supply (5V),</li>
<li>Pin 6 serves as GND,</li>
<li>Pin 8 is the RX pin and should be connected to the TX pad on the flight controller,</li>
<li>Pin 10 is the TX pin and should be connected to the RX pad on the flight controller.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This setup enables both power delivery and bidirectional communication between the Raspberry Pi and the flight controller.</p>
</li>
</ul>
